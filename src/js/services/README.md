# Services

The "services" folder is where your data providers or "services" go. A "service" is defined
as something that remains the same, and can be called upon from several areas of logic,
related or otherwise, in this case to make asynchronous requests to the SilverStripe
backend for data as JSON from graphql endpoints.
